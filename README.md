# Snake Pro

A simple adaptation of the popular Snake game, built with new challenges and game mechanics. The project is built using Pygame. This readme will be updated as the development progresses.

# Objective
Object-oriented programming (OOP) and interactive applications were my motivations for this project. I like Pythonâ€™s syntax and structure. Having spent considerable time learning it in this program I decided to do my final project based on it. Snake games have been relatively the same for decades and I decided to try some new ideas in building my version of it.

# How to run
I built this on my Ubuntu WSL terminal. So you have to install Pygame to play it.
```
pip install pygame
```
My original intent was to turn it into an installable package using Pyinstaller. However, I am out of time and other resources at the moment. More on that in the next section. Here is a YouTube demo of my progress so far https://youtu.be/LpTHsr_kUus.

# Problems
Becoming a developer in Nigeria is an extreme sport. A day after this project began, the electric transformer in my neighborhood blew up during a storm. This incident cut down my work time from 7 - 10 hours to about 3 hours with a backup generator. Sadly I am a full-time ALX student, so I don't currently have any proper way to earn. But I could at least work with the backup generator, or so I thought. The following week, the new government removed the subsidy on fuel, which raised the price of gasoline (petrol) from about N184 to N540 per liter. I was devastated. I still am. The progress I have made so far is what I could do with the time I have on my backup generator.

At this point, I have to figure out how to earn to keep going. Tech is not for the weak ðŸ˜…. I am also burnt out from averaging 7 - 10 hours every day for the past 9 months. But enough ranting. Setbacks are a part of every journey.

# What I have learned
Object-Oriented Programming has its drawbacks. Code can quickly become verbose which makes it harder to keep track of parameter changes. Also renaming variables and functions can be a pain as you have to trace every variable declaration and function call to update them. Executing logic can also be tricky when deciding when and where to make function calls, implement conditions to respond to events, and change parameters. This is probably not an issue for more experienced engineers, but it is nice to notice it as a beginner.

Apps with interactive designs such as games look deceptively simple to do. They are not. Creating events and responses only seem obvious after you get it right, but it involves trying and testing a lot of things repeatedly, sometimes breaking the code too.

Finally, building a game in two weeks is not a good idea. Doing it when you are supposed to present it when you don't have constant power will leave you emotionally scarred. ðŸ˜…
